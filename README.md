# Regression Project - ChatGPT Reviews

## General Information
We are given a dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/chatgpt-user-feedback) containing daily-updated user reviews and ratings for ChatGPT app in the past two years. 
We want to determine how the number of likes a post receives and whether the post is positive affects the rating score.
Identify the best regression machine learning model to predict the correlation between the variables thumbsUp count and rating scores, and the positivity level of the posts.
